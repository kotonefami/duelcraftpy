# duelcraftpy

日本語版は[こちら](README.md)です。
A card game that can be run in Python.

# Demo
 
See [demo.py](demo.py).
 
# Features
 
When I was in elementary school, I made a lot of card games, but I used to play Discord bots with simple and expandable ones.

However, variables and functions were messed up and in a spaghetti state, so I made it with the intention of making it a module.
 
# Requirement
 
Please use with Python 3 or above.

Python 3.9 is used for development and testing.

No required library.
 
# Installation
 
Download the [duelcraftpy](duelcraftpy) folder and import it.

It also supports `` `from duelcraftpy import *` ``.
